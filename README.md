Functional programming
======================

This repository holds all files for the `Functioneel programmeren` course as given at the University of Twente in the first quartile of 2014-2015. Some packages have to be installed for Haskell to make it work.

```bash
$ cabal update
$ cabal install twentefp-graphs twentefp-number twentefp-trees twentefp-websockets
```
